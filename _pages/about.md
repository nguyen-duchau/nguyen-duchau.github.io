I am a Ph.D. candidate at [Linkmedia](https://www-linkmedia.irisa.fr/) team of [IRISA - CNRS](https://www.irisa.fr/), under the guidance of [Guillaume Gravier](https://people.irisa.fr/Guillaume.Gravier/) and [Pascale Sebillot](https://people.irisa.fr/Pascale.Sebillot/). My research topic is about the explainability Deep Learning (or XAI - eXplainable AI) in the NLP (Natural Language Processing) domain application. Specifically, my current research investigate whether models using attention mechanism can provide human-like explanations (what we call the plausibility of explanations). Our intent is to use them to explain semantic links between texts in the [Archival project](https://www.fmsh.fr/projets/archival)[^note].

[^note]: Funded by ANR-19-CE38-0011-03 from the French National Research Agency (ANR)

My defense is expected in **October 11, 2024**, but I am currently available for a new job (permanent/CDI or post-doc). Ideally, I would like to work on topics closely related to my research fields (**Natural Language Processing**, **Computer Vision** and/or **eXplainable AI**), within an R&D department in the industry (I believe that science is more meaningful when used to solve real-world problems). However, I am open to all opportunities one may offer, as long as my contributions are to solve any problems.
